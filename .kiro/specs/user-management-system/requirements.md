# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a user management system that provides authentication, user CRUD operations, and role-based access control. The system will support two user roles (Administrator and Reviewer) with different permission levels, and includes features like email notifications, data validation, and security measures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log into the system using my email and password, so that I can access the user management interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a simple form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the user list page
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and remain on the login page
4. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page when accessing protected routes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view a list of all registered users, so that I can see the current user base and their information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the user list page THEN the system SHALL display a table with columns: ID, Name(s), Last Name(s), Email, Role, and Registration Date
2. WHEN the user list loads THEN the system SHALL show all users in the database (excluding logically deleted ones)
3. WHEN a user has Administrator role THEN the system SHALL display action buttons (create, edit, delete) for each user
4. WHEN a user has Reviewer role THEN the system SHALL display only the user information without action buttons

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Administrator, I want to create new users through a popup form, so that I can add new team members to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Administrator clicks the "Create User" button THEN the system SHALL open a popup with fields: Name(s), Last Name(s), Email, Password, and Role selector
2. WHEN creating a user THEN the system SHALL provide a role selector with options "Administrator" and "Reviewer"
3. WHEN the Administrator submits valid user data THEN the system SHALL create the user and send credentials via email
4. WHEN the Administrator submits invalid data THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
5. WHEN a user is successfully created THEN the system SHALL refresh the user list and close the popup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Administrator, I want to edit existing user information through a popup form, so that I can update user details when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Administrator clicks the "Edit" button for a user THEN the system SHALL open a popup pre-filled with current user data
2. WHEN editing a user THEN the system SHALL allow modification of Name(s), Last Name(s), Email, Password, and Role
3. WHEN the Administrator submits valid updated data THEN the system SHALL update the user information
4. WHEN the Administrator submits invalid data THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
5. WHEN a user is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the user list and close the popup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Administrator, I want to delete users from the system, so that I can remove inactive or unauthorized users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Administrator clicks the "Delete" button for a user THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation
2. WHEN the Administrator confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL perform a logical deletion (soft delete)
3. WHEN a user is logically deleted THEN the system SHALL no longer display them in the user list
4. WHEN a user is logically deleted THEN the system SHALL maintain their data in the database with a deleted flag

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based access control implemented, so that users can only perform actions appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has Administrator role THEN the system SHALL allow all CRUD operations on users
2. WHEN a user has Reviewer role THEN the system SHALL only allow viewing the user list
3. WHEN a Reviewer attempts to access create/edit/delete functions THEN the system SHALL deny access and show appropriate error
4. WHEN checking user permissions THEN the system SHALL validate roles on both frontend and backend

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system, I want to validate all user input and protect against security vulnerabilities, so that the application remains secure and data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate all fields on the backend
2. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error messages
3. WHEN accessing protected routes THEN the system SHALL use middleware to verify authentication
4. WHEN accessing role-specific functions THEN the system SHALL use middleware to verify authorization
5. WHEN displaying user data THEN the system SHALL implement frontend security measures to hide unauthorized actions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to receive my login credentials via email, so that I can access the system immediately after account creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user is created THEN the system SHALL send an email with their credentials
2. WHEN sending credentials email THEN the system SHALL use a free email service for development
3. WHEN the email fails to send THEN the system SHALL log the error but still create the user
4. WHEN sending the email THEN the system SHALL include the user's email and password in a secure format

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be properly initialized with sample data, so that I can test and demonstrate functionality immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is first set up THEN the system SHALL use migrations to create database structure
2. WHEN initializing data THEN the system SHALL use seeders to create 100 random user records
3. WHEN generating sample data THEN the system SHALL use factories to create realistic user information
4. WHEN seeding data THEN the system SHALL include users with both Administrator and Reviewer roles

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and testing, so that the system is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive code documentation
2. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL include a detailed README.md file
3. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for all configuration
4. WHEN testing the system THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for critical functionality
5. WHEN deploying the system THEN the system SHALL be available on GitHub with proper version control
